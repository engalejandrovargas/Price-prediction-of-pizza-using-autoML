## Introduction
This project aims to predict the price of pizzas using machine learning algorithms and AutoML frameworks. The project uses a dataset containing various features like size, toppings, and location to make accurate predictions.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- company
- diameter
- extra_sauce
- extra_cheese
- extra_mushrooms
- Size
- Toppings
- Location
- Price

## Methodology
This project uses the following machine learning algorithms and AutoML frameworks:
- XGB Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor
- AutoML Framework (EVAL ML)

## Results
The project achieved an accuracy of XX% using the Random Forest algorithm and XX% using the AutoML framework.
